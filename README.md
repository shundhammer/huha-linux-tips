# HuHa's Linux Tips

This is a random collection of tips and tricks about Linux.

I collected them over the course of a couple of years as a Linux home user and
a Linux system developer. They may or may not be useful for anybody else. For
some things, there may be different approaches, or even better ones; but what I
describe here worked for me at the time I needed a solution.
